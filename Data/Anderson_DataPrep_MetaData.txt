Description of data:
This data was collected by Edward Faison and David Foster as part of the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Project, and for a masters thesis written by Edward Faison. The sites of collection were 156 sites across 2 large, forested watersheds in Central Massachusetts, with data collected in 2005 but published in 2023. This data was collected to study how moose interact with temperate forests, as they are become abundant in these areas again recently. The researchers wanted to study the impact of moose herbivory on vegetation, and what habitat features determine moose winter foraging activity. 



Key to columns:

For the Moose_Plot_Data -
	plot = the unique plot identification number

	browse_index = sum of proportion of browsed stems and total stems browsed/2

	lat = latitude

	elev = elevation (meters)

	dist_h2o = distance (meters) from the plot to the nearest wetland or water body

	hilltop = is the plot located on a hilltop (0 = no, 1 = yes)

	swamp = is the plot located in a swamp (area with saturated soil and wetland plant indicators) (0 = no, 1 = yes)

	wetland_forest = is the plot located in a swamp or floodplain forest (0 = no, 1 = yes)

	tall_shrubs = the density of shrub stems that are over 1.8m high in the 200m² area surveyed

	dist_conifer = distance (meters) to the nearest patch of conifer forest 

	hemlock_ba = relative % of basal area of hemlock in the plot

	sugar_maple_ba = relative % of basal area of sugar maple in the plot

	red_maple_ba = relative % of basal area of red maple in the plot

	spruce_fir_ba = relative % of basal area of spruce and fir combined in the plot

	oak_ba = relative % of basal area of all oak species in the plot

	white_pine_ba = relative % of basal area of white pine in the plot

	harvest_intensity = amount of basal area removed from a harvested stand (m²/ha)

	watershed = the watershed forest where the plot was located. 0 is Quabbin Forest, 1 is Ware River Forest

	deer_density = estimated number of deer per km² in the area the plot was located

	harvest = harvest status of the plot. 0 is the plot was located in an unharvested stand, 1 is the plot was located in a harvested area

	dist_dev = distance (meters) from the plot to the nearest developed area (developed area defined by MassGIS). Distances greater than 1000m were assigned a value of 1000. 


For the Moose_Tree_Data
	plot = the unique plot identification number

	species = the tree species or genus name

	dbh = diameter at breast height (cm) of the tree. Seedlings under 2.5cm assigned NA

	count = the number of stems on the tree

	browsed = whether the tree was browsed at the height of above 1.8meters and below 3meters. 0 is unbrowsed, 1 is browsed, NA is no stems were within the available browse range or the browse status was inconclusive so the stem was not assessed.

	stripped = whether the tree was stripped at the height of above 1.8meters and below 3meters. 0 is stem bark not stripped, 1 is stem bark stripped.

	broken = whether the tree was broken at the height of above 1.8meters and below 3meters. 0 is stem not broken by moose, 1 is stem broken by moose. 



Changes made to the original dataset:
1) Saved my own copies of the two datasets to modify (Moose_Plot_Data and Moose_Tree_Data).
2) Changed the periods to underscores in the columns of the Moose_Plot_Data file.
