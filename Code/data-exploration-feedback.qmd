## Data Exploration Feedback

Hi Liz,

Looking great so far! A few thoughts.

1.  I don't think you need to change the plot habitats (swamp, hilltop, etc.) to logical - you might be better served to leave them as 0/1 data. Same for tree browsed/stripped/broken. I would leave them as is.
2.  Do you recall how to use ggplot for your box plots? They will look a bit nicer/be easier to interpret if you do.
3.  I think your decision to keep all the points rather than get rid of outliers is a good one. But I'd like to see you doing more to plot your data to get a feel for the distribution - you could facet to make the plotting faster.
4.  Your data (many of your variables) are what we refer to as "zero-inflated" because you have lots of zero values - which is fine. Happens a lot in ecology, and we may have to take it into account during the analysis.
5.  At line 121, you are going to end up using something called "pivot_longer" to reformat your data so that you can have a single column called "interaction" with values of browsed, stripped, or broken â€“ I appreciate that you tried to figure it out!
6.  In your scatterplots, you may wish to think about whether you could fit a line to the points if you only considered the red or the blue points but not the whole point cloud - in other words, does the possible association depend on if they are hunted or not, etc?
7.  For your first hypothesis, whether there is a relationship b/w whether a tree was interacted with and species/dbh, I think your response variable is actually going to be the NUMBER of interactions of each type (browse, strip, broken) and you may add the type of interaction as another predictor.

You are making nice progress!
